1 - Train joint Bert+MLP in a supervised fashion: [bert_mlp](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/RecSys2020/tree/master/python/supervised_bert_model/bert_mlp) 

2 - Extract the embeddings: [bert_mlp](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/RecSys2020/tree/master/python/supervised_bert_model/bert_mlp)

3 - Process the embeddings: [process_embeddings](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/RecSys2020/tree/master/python/supervised_bert_model/process_embeddings)

4 - Train or infer another MLP on top of these embeddings (and the other features): [mlp_on_embeddings](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/RecSys2020/tree/master/python/supervised_bert_model/mlp_on_embeddings)
