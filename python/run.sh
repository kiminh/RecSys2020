# Download the following files from S3:
# 1. XLM-Roberta and Bert models weights, and inference embeddings into $DL_DATA_PATH/DL_Data/embeddings/xlm-r and $DL_DATA_PATH/DL_Data/embeddings/bert respectively
# 2. model checkpoints, placing them in $DL_DATA_PATH/DL_Checkpoints

# Train the multilayer perceptron (MLP) models and then perform inference on the Valid, Submit and Test sets
# The 4 csv output/submission files are saved under python/out/train(val)/modelname/engagements.csv

cd $DLPATH"/mlp_model"

# This concludes our "main pipeline". At this point we have 4/9 (+1 for the XGBoost model) of the models used in the final blend.
# The following instructions will describe reproducing 1+(2) other models used in the blend: supervised fine-tuning of Bert
# and using history embeddings.


# Supervised Bert fine-tuning
# Train the MLP model on supervised fine-tuned embeddings and then perform inference on the Valid, Submit and Test sets
cd $DLPATH"/supervised_bert_model/mlp_on_embeddings"
run.sh

# The 4 csv output/submission files are saved under $DL_DATA_PATH/DL_Ouputs/(train)(val)(submit)(test)/modelname/(engagement).csv


# History embedding model (Tested on a box with 600GB RAM)
# Train the MLP model on XLM-R embeddings with history and then perform inference on the Valid, Submit and Test sets
cd $DLPATH"/history_model"
run.sh

# The 4 csv output/submission files are saved under $DL_DATA_PATH/DL_Ouputs/(train)(val)(submit)(test)/modelname/(engagement).csv

# Finally the prediction scores are blended
# Please make sure all the predictions files are in $DL_DATA_PATH/DL_Ouputs in the following format:
# (train)(val)(submit)(test)/modelname/(engagement).csv

# run blender
cd $DLPATH"/post_processing"
run_blender.sh
# this should output the predictions from the blended model to $DL_DATA_PATH/DL_Ouputs/test/blended

# run temperature tuning (done only for 1 out of 2 submissions)
run_temperature_scaling.sh
# this should output the scaled predictions to $DL_DATA_PATH/DL_Ouputs/test/blended_and_scaled
