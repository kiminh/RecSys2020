blender.py takes as input prediction files generated by different models and blends them. The output is the blended probabilities in (tweet id, user id, probability) form. For blending we use following modeles:

- xlmr 
- bert
- supervised bert
- history model
- feature only MLP
- XGB

temperature_scaling.py takes as input 4 csv files that are the predictions of the model in (tweet id, user id, probaiblity) tab separated format and scales each task's logits by some temperature. The output is the scaled probabilities in (tweet id, user id, probability) form.
